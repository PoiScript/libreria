The force between two very small objects separated in a vacuum or free space by a distance, which is large compared to their size, is proportional to the charge on each and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, or:

$$\vec{F}=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{R^2}$$

This will be achieved if the constant of proportional $K$ is written as

$$k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$

The new constant $\epsilon_0$ is called the permittivity of free space and has magnitude, measured in farads per meter (F/m),

$$\epsilon_0=8.854x10^{-12}=\frac{1}{36\pi}10^{-9}F/m$$

Coulomb's law is now:

$$\vec{F}=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0R^2}$$

Coulomb's law is linear, for if we multiply $Q_1$ by a factor $n$, the force on $Q_2$ is also multiplied by the same factor $n$.
